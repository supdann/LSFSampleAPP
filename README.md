* **Overview**

As part of my Bachelor's Thesis, I created an iOS App proposal for the management portal of the University of Applied Sciences Berlin (LSF).

Such an App needs of course a backend side, that supplies the required information to be displayed. But this doesn't exist yet (by February 2018). The app can be tested using this Test API.

The goal behind this, is to motivate the implementation of an API on behalf of the university, that third party developers can use to create new stuff. The cool thing is that this developers could even be the students themselves and the further implementation of missing features or improvement of existing ones, could be used as project topics, e.g. for the IMI Showtime.

## TODOs
Would you like to work on some pending features? Take a look at the following list with ideas and improvements that have not been completed or implemented yet.

If you have any other ideas please add them to the list! Just edit the file a create a pull request.
